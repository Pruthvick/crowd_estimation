# Crowd Estimation & Flow Direction

This project implements **crowd counting, density estimation, and crowd flow direction estimation** using deep learning. It includes training and testing scripts and a simple **Flask web app** to demo predictions on images.

## Features
- Crowd **count estimation** using density maps  
- **Flow direction estimation** for crowd movement  
- Models for **dense and sparse crowds**  
- Web interface to upload images and view predictions  
- Visualization of results and error plots  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch  
- OpenCV, NumPy  
- Flask
